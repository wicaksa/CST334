1. Explain what happens when you run this threadHello.c program; 
   - Can you list how many threads are created and what values of i are passed? 
   10 threads are created values of 0-9 for i.
   - Do you get the same result if you run it multiple times? 
   You get a different result every time. 
   - What if you are also running some other demanding processes (e.g., compiling a big program, playing a Flash game on a website, or watching streaming video) when you run this program?
   It will most likely slow it down since it will be sharing CPU space when it runs the threads. 
   - The function go() has the parameter arg passed a local variable. 
   - Are these variables per-thread or shared state? 
   - Where does the compiler store these variablesâ€™ states?
   - The main() has local variable i. Is this variable per-thread or shared state? Where does the compiler store this variable?
     This variable is shared because it gets accessed by all of the threads. It is stored in the stack.
   - Write down your observations. You probably have seen that there is a bug in the program, where threads may print same values of i. Why?
     This happens because of race condition. One variable might still be in the process of reading a variable while the variable has been changed thus causing duplicates iterations.

2. Write the fix for the program in Step 1, then run your revised program to demonstrate your fix.
   To fix this program, you need to store the iterations in another data structure then access it for each thread so that each thread will have a unique iteration number. 

3. Matrix multiplication with threads 
   This portion of the lab was quite difficult but after breaking it down, made it a lot easier. I encountered a lot of bugs the main being a bus error. This occurs when you are trying to  Access something in memory that is not there. The error was made when I was populating my for loop. I used the wrong variable to increment it.
