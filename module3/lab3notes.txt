# Description: Notes and observations for Lab 3

Notes/Observations
- The lab was fairly straight forward. 
- Step 3 took a lot of debugging because I could not get the program to put out any result.
- Step 3 compiled perfectly.
- My error was using the execpl() function; I used the wrong parameters.
- ie) I used "grep root" "grep root" instead of separating them into "grep" "grep" "root"


Questions
- Do we need to check when the pipe fails with a condition in the beginning?
